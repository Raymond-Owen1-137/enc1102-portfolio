    <p>This ePortfolio reflects my development in inquiry, multimodal writing, information evaluation, genre adaptation, knowledge contribution, and iterative revision. Through these artifacts, I have demonstrated a robust set of writing and research skills that will support my future work in both academic and professional contexts. I look forward to applying these abilities to new challenges and continuing to refine my craft as a researcher and communicator.</p>
