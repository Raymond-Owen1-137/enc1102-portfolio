    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>In this research paper, I demonstrate Generating Inquiry by formulating a significant question about how media narratives shape public perception of Bitcoin. Rather than simply describing cryptocurrency trends, I engaged in a deeper exploration of rhetorical framing and its societal impact. I combined digital methods—like sentiment analysis of over 5,000 headlines—with close rhetorical readings to track shifts between utopia and dystopia, hype and fear. This project reflects my capacity to extend academic dialogues about technology, language, and culture. By placing my question at the intersection of financial data and media studies, I connected personal curiosity to larger scholarly debates, showing genuine engagement with writing-related inquiries beyond classroom prompts.</p>
