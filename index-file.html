    <h2>Researcher's Statement</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my ENC1102 ePortfolio. This site showcases my growth as a writer and researcher throughout the semester, reflecting my ability to engage with complex topics, adapt to various writing genres, and think critically about language and rhetoric.</p>
    <p>As a writer, I value clarity, analytical depth, and adaptability. My work this semester focused on blending traditional research methods with digital tools, particularly in exploring media narratives. Influenced by my background in physics and a passion for technology, I approach writing as both a creative and analytical process. My strongest skills include synthesizing diverse sources, constructing persuasive arguments, and revising effectively based on feedback. Looking ahead, I aim to apply these skills in academic research and professional settings where clear communication and critical inquiry are essential.</p>
