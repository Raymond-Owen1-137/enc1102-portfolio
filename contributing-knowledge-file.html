    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>In this project, I contributed Knowledge by developing new insights on how media framing—not just market forces—constructs Bitcoin's public identity. By combining sentiment trends with rhetorical frame analysis, I revealed a decoupling between price euphoria and media tone, challenging assumptions about market-driven legitimacy. My findings extend scholarly discussions on media influence and digital currency, offering a nuanced view of narrative power in financial discourse. This artifact reflects my ability to synthesize evidence, identify gaps in existing literature, and make an original scholarly contribution that advances understanding within rhetoric, media studies, and economics.</p>
